My name is Luccas, and I am a Brazilian student, graduated in the technical course of **Systems Development** at ETEC. I dedicate myself fully to expanding my knowledge in various areas of technology, and I have a great curiosity to learn and push myself to the limit in everything I do.
I have a special interest in improving my skills in **Java**, **PHP**, and **Databases**. Additionally, I am particularly focused on **web development**, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I am excited to continue learning and growing in the tech field, and I am always looking for new opportunities to put what I learn into practice. Iâ€™m happy to meet you!
